## Architecture

### A Look Back
* n-Tier Architecture
* SOA
* Microservices Architecture

### The Serverless Architectural Pattern
* Why do we need a new architectural pattern?
* Functions as a Service (FaaS)
* How do we get there?
  * Need for agile development lifecycles
  * Need for independent teams working in parallel
  * Focus on building than managing infrastructure

### Event-Driven Architecture
* Cooperative Development (sharing events) 

### Partitioning Logic
* Nanoservices
* Microservices
* Monolithic
* GraphQL
