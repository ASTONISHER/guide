Some guidance as to what needs to go in this section:

* Tell the story about the shift in the role of DevOps
* It is not NoOps, but DifferentOps
* How serverless is changing our look beyond infrastructure
* Some new problems emerging for DevOps teams
* How is it changing the way we manage applications?
* Shift from mundane work of managing infrastructure to taking care of business
* More time and resources to monitor health, load, bottlenecks of applications

Feel free to add/modify the sub-sections.
