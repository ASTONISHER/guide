## Development

We as developers love to code. We hack on the newest cutting-edge technolgoies. We get excited about the future when we see a new technology like serverless. We jump at the 'hello-world' example, and are pumped when we get it going. Then we dream about using the technology to write our favorite application. That's when the painful path to developing a fully functioning application hits us. We pour over the documentation, read the blogs, and try some more examples. Yet it feels complicated and more like a wild goose chase. We lose sight of our application. We lose sight of our vision. We feel entangled in technology. We move on to the next one...

**It does not have to be that way.** 

The serverless movement has legs. We are poised to make the Serverless Framework the best in-class opensource offering. It makes developing & deploying applications fun again.

New technology brings new learning and new challenges. Let's work towards resolving it together as a community.
