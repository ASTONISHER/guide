### Pathway to Serverless Development

The excitement around serverless technologies is huge and is growing each day. The developer is challenged with a steep learning curve due to the yet-to-be-mature state of the serverless space. AWS Lambda has led the serverless movement and provided a solid platform for developing & deploying serverless applications. A whole slew of services around AWS Lambda makes it possible to write multi-service applications. The space is brimming with new services like Auth0, Firebase, IOPipe, Stripe, Cloudant, to name a few, that can integrate well into the serverless architecture.

Following the lead of AWS Lambda, the space has also warmed up to new serverless compute providers, namely, Microsoft Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions and IBM OpenWhisk. It is a good indication of popularity of the serverless architecture. It has opened up the servreless space and given the developers a choice to pick from a variety of providers, services and platforms. While that is all good, it has also introduced a lot of complexity for the application developer.
