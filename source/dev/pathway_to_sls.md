### Pathway to Serverless Development

The excitement around serverless technologies is huge and is growing each day. The developer is challenged with a steep learning curve due to the yet-to-be-mature state of the serverless space. AWS Lambda has led the serverless movement and provided a solid platform for developing & deploying serverless applications. A whole slew of services around AWS Lambda makes it possible to write multi-service applications. The space is brimming with new services like Auth0, Firebase, IOPipe, Stripe, Cloudant, to name a few, that can integrate well into the serverless architecture.

Following the lead of AWS Lambda, the space has also warmed up to new serverless compute providers, namely, Microsoft Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions and IBM OpenWhisk. It is a good indication of popularity of the serverless architecture. It has opened up the servreless space and given the developers a choice to pick from a variety of providers, services and platforms. While that is all good, it has also introduced a lot of complexity for the application developer.

#### The Serverless Framework

The Serverless Framework is the worldâ€™s leading development framework for building serverless architectures. It helps build applications comprised of microservices that run in response to events, auto-scale for you, and only charge you when they run. This lowers the total cost of maintaining your apps, enabling you to build more logic, faster. Serverless is an MIT open-source project, actively maintained by a vibrant and engaged community of developers.

#### Why use the Serverless Framework?

The Serverless Framework abstracts away the complexity involved in stitching together the different pieces of a serverless application. It provides an easy entry into the serverless space, by allowing a quick path in building and deploying your first serverless application. It abstracts developers from potential provider lock-in, by providing simple configuration options to manage that. The various levels of abstractions and easy to use CLI, keeps the developer focused in building the application rather than being overwhelmed by the technology itself. It enables agility to deploy, 100% utlilization by not worrying about paying for idle server time, infinite & automatic scalability, and flexible application structure for easy management of code.

#### Getting Started

The Serverless Framework is a CLI tool that allows users to build & deploy auto-scaling, pay-per-execution, event-driven functions. It enables writing code, configuring events that trigger the functions, then deploying & running those functions on a cloud provider of your choice via the Serverless CLI.
