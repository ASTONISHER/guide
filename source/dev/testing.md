* Effects on unit and integration testing. New trends, problems etc.
* How has serverless changed CI/CD and effected automation in dev to deployment cycles?
* Any emerging tooling for testing?
* Showcase any best practices evolving around test-driven development

Feel free to add/modify the sub-sections.
