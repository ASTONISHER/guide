### Debugging

***
Some guidance as to what needs to go in this section:

* What are the challenges around debugging serverless services and apps?
* What are some of the workarounds that exist?
* Is it practically impossible to trace through functions in the cloud? 
* What problems do event-driven architectures bring to the surface?
* 

Feel free to add/modify the sub-sections.
