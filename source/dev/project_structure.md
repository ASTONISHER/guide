### Project Structure


***
Some guidance as to what needs to go in this section:

* How should a multi-services app be structured?
* What are best practices for breaking apart services? 
* How should I organize repos for services? one repo or multiple repos?
* What are the pain points of either cases?
* How do you manage configuration for services?
* How to manage secrets for services?
* How to organise or group functions? 

Feel free to add/modify the sub-sections.
