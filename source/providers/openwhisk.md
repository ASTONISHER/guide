## IBM OpenWhisk

OpenWhisk is IBM's serverless copute offering, with experimental service announced in early 2016.

> OpenWhisk is an event-driven compute platform that executes application logic in response to events or through direct invocationsâ€“from web/mobile apps or other endpoints. The OpenWhisk serverless architecture accelerates development as a set of small, distinct, and independent actions. By abstracting away infrastructure, OpenWhisk frees members of small teams to rapidly work on different pieces of code simultaneously, keeping the overall focus on creating user experiences customers want.

The IBM serverless platform consists of the compute service called OpenWhisk. It integrates well with other IBM Bluemix services like:

* Cloudant
