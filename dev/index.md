## Development

We as developers love to code. We hack on the newest cutting-edge technolgoies. We get excited about the future when we see a new technology like serverless. We jump at the 'hello-world' example, and are pumped when we get it going. Then we dream about using the technology to write our favorite application. That's when the painful path to developing a fully functioning application hits us. We pour over the documentation, read the blogs, and try some more examples. Yet it feels complicated and more like a wild goose chase. We lose sight of our application. We lose sight of our vision. We feel entangled in technology. We move on to the next one...

**It does not have to be that way.** The serverless movement has legs. We are poised to make the Serverless Framework the best in-class opensource offering, to make it super easy for developers to develop & deploy applications in a serverless fashion.

New technology brings new learning and new challenges. Let's work towards resolving it together as a community.

There is a whole new culture that is evolving to internalize the serverless movement. 

### Culture

* How do I form teams?
* Microservice/developer autonomy 
* How do I train my teams?
* How do I hire?
* Practices 
    * [How to migrate your talent to the cloud](https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/how-to-migrate-your-talent-to-the-cloud-bdfaf33784e4#.5delrn9jk)

### Pathway to Serverless Development

* Boilerplate to a functioning app [example]
* Using a shared function [example]
* Sharing my function across apps [example]
* Using a 3rd party service [Auth0 example]

### Project Structure
* How does this fit in with git?
* What are best practices for breaking apart services? 
* How should I organize repos? 

### Continous Integration/Development

### Deployment  
* How to I continuously deploy?
* How do I do staging?
* Rollbacks?    

### Testing
* Best practices? 
* How do I do continuous integration? 
* How do I unit test?

### Examples
