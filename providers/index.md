## Providers

*[For each provider highlight their product, advantages, limitations, use cases, etc.]*

### Introduction

The serverless technology has raised a lot of eyebrows in the community in the last few years and the few big players have stepped up to release their own serverless compute infrastructure platforms. 

The Serverless Framework recognizes the concern involving provider lock-in and complexity to adopt these platforms. So under the hood, the Serverless Framework lets the user pick an infrastructure provider, and develop & deploy applications to it.

We will take a look at some popular AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure Functions, IBM OpenWhisk, Google Cloud Functions, Webtask.io and Iron.io platforms in more detail.

### The Players

Some of the popular players in the horizon are:

#### AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is Amazon's serverless compute offering, announced in 2015. 

> AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.

#### Microsoft Azure Functions

Azure Functions is Microsoft's serverless compute offering, announced in spring of 2016.

> Process events with a serverless code architecture. An event-based serverless compute experience to accelerate your development. Scale based on demand and pay only for the resources you consume.
