## Guidelines

Since we as a community are writing and contributing to different sections of the guide, it will need a lot of love, a bit of guidance and discipline. Here are a few things to the  make the content of high-quality, coherent and consistent.

**Vocabulary:** Use the [serverless terminologies](./terminology.md) guide to keep the verbiage consistent.

**Voice**: Write in second-person, active voice so that the content is concise, to the point yet personable.

**Opinion Snippets:** We encourage personal opinions, vendor choices, and quotes that add credibility to the content. A simple `blockquote` would make it stand out. For example:

> I built an end-to-end CI/CD toolchain using [name tools]. - *John Doe, CEO at Acme Corporation*

> Using [platform/service] from [vendor] has dramatically reduced our cost of doing business. - *Mary Jane, CTO at Hooli*

**Proof-reading:** Check your content for spelling mistakes and grammar. [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) is a pretty good tool.
