- Are you excited about the serverless movement and talk about its future?
- Do you have an example of a serverless usecase that you want to highlight?
- Are you a developer who has expertise in a particular serverless provider?
- Do you work for a provider and see some inconsistencies in the content?
- Is there an architectural pattern that you feel solves a specific usecase?
- Do you have a success story that you would like to share?
- Have you been successful with a specific vendor or platform?
- Do you have an opinion/quote that you would like to add in a section?

**Then you have lots to share with the community.**

We want your contributions to this guide. We would like you to bring in your expertise to showcase them in this guide. We are aiming to create a world-class guide that excites everyone to join the serverless movement. We feel we can achieve that by creating authentic content that is driven by the community. 

## Contribute

It is very easy to contribute:

- Pick a section of the guide to contribute.
- Open an issue describing the section and/or sub-sections that you will be working on and assign the issue to yourself.
- Make sure you have read the [Guidelines](#guidelines) section.
- Write to your heart's content and proof read it. 
- Commit your changes and open a PR.

It is that simple!!!

A very lean and simple review process will ensure all is good, and then the PRs will be merged.

## Guidelines

Since we as a community will be writing and contributing to different sections of the guide, it will need a lot of love and a bit of guidance and discipline. Here are a few things that can make the guide be of high-quality content that is coherent and consistent.

**Vocabulary:** Use the [serverless terminologies](./terminology.md) guide to keep the verbiage consistent.

**Voice**: Write in second-person, active voice so that the content is concise, to the point yet personable.

**Opinion Snippets:** We encourage personal opinions, vendor choices, and quotes that add credibility to the content. A simple `blockquote` would make it stand out. For example:

> I built an end-to-end CI/CD toolchain using [name tools]. - *John Doe, CEO at Acme Corporation*

> Using [platform/service] from [vendor] has dramatically reduced our cost of doing business. - *Mary Jane, CTO at Hooli*

**Proof-reading:** Check your content for spelling mistakes and grammar. [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) is a pretty good tool.

## Street Cred

Your name will be added to the list of contributors at the end of the guide.
